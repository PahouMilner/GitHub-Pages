  <h3>Project Idea:</h3>
  <p>
    My project idea is to create a hyper-casual game for mobile devices using construct 2. I hope to incorporate multiple types of game mechanics to make the game more enjoyable while still trying to keep the game simple, easy to understand and addictive to play.
Some of the tasks will include creating a high-quality mobile user face designing characters and levels, marketing and advertising the game properly, ensuring there are no errors in game and also making sure the game is complete and functional.
  </p>
  <h3>Motivation:</h3>
  <p>
    Hyper-casual games are the highest played type of game on mobile devices, I would like to explore the different way of making a game and the different methods of making a game that people can play for short or long period of time and without having to take too much time to learn intricate details that may take hours or days to get the hang of and understand completely.
Mobile gaming is growing within the gaming industry and casual games are one of the most marketable mobile gaming genres, creating a game that is both enjoyable and profitable is a big motivation for me.
  </p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>
    The game will be a timing/puzzle game where the difficulty gradually increases the further you progress through the game.
The play styles will include a story mode with three set difficulties (Normal, hard and impossible), a longest distance mode where the user only has a single chance to progress as far as they can without making a mistake, the longest distance the user manages to obtain will be saved and shared on a leader board for all other users to see and also a game mode where the users main goal is to destroy as many enemies as possible without making a mistake the highest score for this will also be displayed on a leader board.
</p>
<h4>Story mode: </h4>
<p>
Story mode: The games main play feature will be a story mode that will consist of completing levels and puzzles, after the user completes a certain amount of levels (5-10) a boss level will become available which upon completing will grant the user bonus rewards.
After successfully completing a level the player will not have to complete the level again (unless they want to).
The story mode will use the jumping/timing game mechanics for all of the non-boss levels the main objective of the player is to move forward and complete levels without getting hit by an enemy or falling through a gap, there will be moving enemies, basic weapons, gaps to jump, collectable items to help players increase the chances of completing levels and also hidden items for the player to collect.
The boss levels will be based on puzzle game dynamics and will also have be completed in a certain timeframe, the amount of time will be based on the difficulty level that the user has chosen at the start of their game.
</p>
<h4>Longest Distance mode:</h4>
<p>
   This mode will allow consist of a “never ending” level which will also use jumping/timing game dynamics. The user will progress as far as possible without making a mistake which after the user fails will give them a score (The score will be displayed in metres) The score will then be saved and displayed on the leader board. The user will only have 5 attempts at this game style every 24hrs. The highest placed users on the leader board will receive items for their game.
</p>
<h4>Survival mode:</h4>
<p>
   The objective of this game is to destroy as many enemies as possible without making a mistake, the difficulty will progress in increments this will go up depending on the number of enemies that the player has defeated. Once the player has failed, they will be given a score and that score will be put onto the leader board. The highest places players in this game mode will also receive items to help progress in the game.
  </p>
  <h3>Tools/Software Needed:</h3>

  <p>
    The tools needed to create this project will include a good game engine, I have decided to use construct 2 to develop my project. Construct 2 is an online game creation tool that doesn’t require programming knowledge it is a good place to start learning game development.
    An image editing tool will also be required such as Adobe Photoshop, Photoshop software allows the user to edit photos and images, it is an extremely versatile editing app and I believe it is a great choice to create the images needed for the project.
    Sound editing software will also be needed to complete the project, Adobe Audition software allows the user to edit sounds or record new sounds another great piece of software I think will greatly improve the quality of the project.

  </p>
  <h3>Skills Needed:</h3>
  <p>
    The skills required to complete this project are knowledge in programming, drawing/art skills, audio skills and also skills in design.
    The software that will be needed includes Construct 2 to create the game, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator to design/edit characters levels etc and also Adobe Audition to generate sounds for the game as well.
    Finding the software required should be easy considering the four pieces of software I have named I already know how to access, finding the skills required could be a time-consuming process, there are many tutorials on the internet to learn the necessary skills as well as courses through learning institutes, both of these options could take a lot of time to gain the skills needed to complete the project.


  </p>
<h3>Outcome:</h3>
  <p>
    The successful completion of this project will be a game that works perfectly is profitable and is significantly different from other similar titles, a game that people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy.
    The impact of this game will hopefully open up a new style of game that is sought after by majority of mobile gamers and increase my skills and knowledge in the game development industry.
