    <h3>Interest in IT</h3>

<p>
My main interests in IT are web development and also game development,
I enjoy the process of coding and linking information and would love to
be able to create a game or website from nothing but an idea.
</p>
<p>
I have had an interest IT since I first started using computers and realising the capabilities that they have. I play a lot of video games and use many different apps/programs and have always wondered exactly how these things work.
</p>
<p>
There wasnâ€™t necessarily a single event that sparked my interst in IT it was more of a series of things over time, thinking of how people can program robots, the internet in general and all the other crazy stuff computers can do has kept me interested over the years.
</p>
<p>
  I have little IT experience only the things I have learned through basic tutorials on the internet, Basic coding, programming and a basic understanding to the way jobs work within IT.

</p>
<p>
The reason I chose to study at RMIT is the flexibility and recommendations I received from other people, Most people spoke highly of RMIT and the online program that they have which had a big pimpact of my choice.
</p>
<p>
I hope to gain a full understating to the IT industry and the different career pathways you can go, I also hope a more complex understanding of programming, different coding languages and how people work together in IT.
