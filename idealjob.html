  <p>
    The job I have chosen is a front end developer, from my understanding this job entails creating the initial layout of pages, creating some visuals and maintaining the web applications. The appealing aspects to this job are the creative side, an attractive salary and is available without having to change location.
  </p>

  <p>
    The job requires a lot of experience in multiple coding languages, experience developing, experience working with rest APIs, proven responsive design knowledge, UX/UI design skills and a good understanding of object-oriented principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently have a basic understanding of HTML and Java.
    I am also currently learning GitHub, Atom and Eclipse.
  </p>
  <p>
    I plan on gaining the required skills and experience through study and a internship or work in similar environments, I will try to learn multiple languages of coding and use of important programs that will help to qualify me for the desired position.
