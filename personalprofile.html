    <p>
      The result to these tests showed me that I am introverted that I listen more than I speak and that I can be assertive when it is necessary. These traits could all help be productive although it may help to try and be less introverted and voice my opinions more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel that being introverted may make it somewhat harder for people to communicate with me. I believe that listening to other would enable me to understand other peoples ideas and help improve things that others might not think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      When joining a team I should try and find a group of people that are more vocal but also have similar traits that I do, I feel like this would improve productivity and the overall quality of the projects we make as a group.
